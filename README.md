# Time Series

The purpose of this project is to design a standardised protocol for the analysis of palaeontological time series data. This will include aspects such as:

- How to treat missing data.
- The optimal method of 'detrending'.
- Autoregressive models.
- How to treat residual data, and statistical biases.
- Model-fitting and correlation analyses.
